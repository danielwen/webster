		<p>In light of the recent development of this website, I decided to help out Daniel and help him with creating some initial substance to post in order to make it at least seem as though we need a website to help organize all the useful information we wish to distribute around.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps the following information may not prove useful to you, but I digress.</p>
<p>So in this first &#8220;blog&#8221; post, and I use the word &#8220;blog&#8221; lightly, I&#8217;ve decided to construct a users guide towards helping all of you cope with the complications and the pain of your standardized testing.</p>
<p>&#8230;or on second thought, maybe I&#8217;m better off giving you a list of complications and pain-inflicting problems associated with standardized testing, and hope that somehow, being more dissatisfied with the system currently in place will bring you comfort. And if not, well I apologize towards all 10 of you who actually read this through: I may have made things worse.</p>
<p><span id="more-156"></span><br />
If you&#8217;re planning on applying to schools across the southern border, you&#8217;ve almost definitely already acquainted yourself with standardized testing by now, by either writing a test or studying for one (unless you&#8217;re taking a gap year: S/O to Tyler). If you&#8217;re not applying to these schools down south,</p>
<p>well&#8230;</p>
<p>unfortunately for you, you&#8217;ve still acquainted yourself with standardized testing in the form of those around you complaining about them.</p>
<p>No matter what or how you&#8217;ve done it, you now all know enough about standardized tests like the SAT and ACT to relate to what I&#8217;m saying. Or the DSST, CLEP, UCAS, or whatever weird acronym you&#8217;ve chosen as your metaphorical method of transportation into college.</p>
<p>Mind you, I personally think CLEP sounds like something you get after consuming tap water in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#8217;ll use my own experiences to guide my example, as although I can&#8217;t speak for any of you, I can only assume you all experienced something similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Rejoice in the dawn of your senior year of Quebec high school, and that you are nearing the end of the worst part your life&#8217;s period of inculcation.</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-169" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-8.52.18-PM-300x159.png" alt="Sike" width="300" height="159" /></p>
<p>In fact, you begin to find out that all of that was the easy part of your educational career. I mean, I guess everyone has been saying that to you for years, but realistically, denial has left you believing that retirement begins at age 17. Not so.</p>
<p>Considering you are destined for grade 12 next year (personally, I made that decision based on the now-unthinkable possibility of completing the IB diploma), you are drawn into the wave of stress to write the SAT (or other parasitic sounding test) in order to get you some sort of base standing on where you can get into University.</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>Out of sheer panic, you drop hundreds of dollars to pay for a bunch of SAT books, most of which is going towards providing you with a source of comfort: I have the material therefore I will prepare for this test.</p>
<p>Step 4:</p>
<p>Register for a test date, paying an eventual additional hundred dollars to write the test.</p>
<p>Then, prepare for this test.</p>
<p>Step 5A: (Many weeks later)</p>
<p>I prepared for this test. I am ready to write it.</p>
<p>Step 5B: (The night before the test)</p>
<p>I (am not) prepared for this test. I am (not) ready to write it.</p>
<p>Regardless of your level of preparedness, you make your way downtown (or to LCC if you were lucky enough to grab a spot) to the testing centre, where you may encounter, as I did, the closest to a dictator one will ever see in North America (seriously, the way some of them read the instructions is more stressful than the entirety of the test itself).</p>
<p>You emerge, several years later, mentally drained and somewhat relieved. It&#8217;s all over, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is where the fun really begins.</p>
<p>Collegeboard, the company which is responsible for the SAT test offers you the possibility of sending four free scores to colleges so long as you send them within the two week period after writing your test. Conveniently, you don&#8217;t get your scores back until after that, so it essentially means firing them off into the darkness. In grade 11, you probably aren&#8217;t even considering any universities seriously yet, and even if you were you wouldn&#8217;t want them receiving a bad score. So you wait it out until it comes time to actually send your scores in to some of your desired universities, you get a lovely page that says something like this:</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-170 aligncenter" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-9.38.27-PM-300x45.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-20 at 9.38.27 PM" width="300" height="45" /></p>
<p>Wait, let me get this straight:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-171 aligncenter" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-9.45.24-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-20 at 9.45.24 PM" width="176" height="86" /></p>
<p>I have to pay a company&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;that I already payed over a hundred dollars to in order to write a test&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; <strong>eleven dollars and twenty five cents</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;<strong>to send an email</strong> with a PDF file attached to it.</p>
<p>Wait, whats this?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-172" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-9.38.48-PM-300x64.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-20 at 9.38.48 PM" width="300" height="64" /></p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to tax me on that?</p>
<p>Lets jump into economics really quickly: as many of you may know, standardized testing is an inelastic good: most people are going to pay for it regardless of how much it costs.</p>
<p>And to be clear: it&#8217;s an expensive price to pay to write a single mass produced test.</p>
<p>But to charge money to literally take my scores and put it in a mailing system online, followed by taxing that as if one was selling a commercial good is borderline criminal activity.</p>
<p>I mean, paying an extra 130$ to apply to 10 schools wasn&#8217;t exactly part of the plan, but at this point, you&#8217;re going to do it anyways, right?</p>
<p>Talk about taking advantage of inelasticity. You IB people can all use this example on your next IA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the bright side of all of this, however, is that at the very least, the testing part of your application process is now over.</p>
<p>Oh, whats that? I need to write subject tests which will test all my knowledge on certain subjects I&#8217;ve learned in high school in order to be eligible for my desired program?</p>
<p>In that case,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like its time to start a new application:</p>
<p>https://careers.mcdonalds.ca/mcd-careers/applicant/</p>
<p style="text-align: center">- &#8211; &#8211; -</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t promise any form of consistency towards posting anything else ever, honestly, but hey, at least now I feel as though I&#8217;ve contributed adequately towards Pre-U life.</p>
<p>Possibly creativity hours for CAS.<br />
Do I get community service for this?</p>
