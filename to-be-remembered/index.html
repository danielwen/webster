	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks back, I was sitting on the couch, alone, writing my Common App personal essay (for the fourth time) when I heard a knock at the door. Outside stood a middle aged man with a sign balanced in his arm, and a large hammer in the other. He was here to &#8220;put up the sign,&#8221; I overheard. I was, at that time, unaware of the small project my town had recently undertaken, to be revealed to you shortly. I later walked outside to inspect the sign that was now planted on my lawn, and found the following:</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-213 aligncenter" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/11/photo-26-1024x768.jpg" alt="photo-26" width="532" height="399" /></p>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, my town had made a small project of identifying all the buildings once homes to soldiers lost to both world wars.</p>
<p>In my personal case, the walls I now live in had once been residence to an artillery soldier by the name of Cpt. Forrest Walker Wiggins. From the short obituary written about him in the Montreal Gazette in 1941, we know that he attended what is now Royal West Academy, and went on to become a three season athlete at McGill. Inspired by his family before him, he dreamed of becoming a serviceman one day, and was granted this wish in 1935. He was among the first waves of soldiers deployed by the Canadian Forces, arriving in England on Christmas day of 1940. He was killed merely three months later, the cause of his death lost to the ages. He was twenty eight years old.</p>
<p><span id="more-212"></span><br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>When you walk down Westminster Avenue, there isn&#8217;t too much that might draw your attention at first. However, once you notice the first of the signs tied to lamp posts like the one I&#8217;ve posted above, it truly serves to identify the way a community might appear following war. Every second lamp post bears a sign dedicated to a single fallen soldier from within my community, and this spans on for at least three blocks. Name after name, address after address, the number of young men lost from a single community that seems minuscule even today only goes to show the magnitude of the loss experienced what could be any small community.</p>
<p>Canada’s death toll seems light when contrasted with those of other countries who suffered during the war. However, we must also consider the percentage of servicemen killed per country, which was high among many of the allies. Those enlisted in the army, like Cpt. Wiggins, faced a one in eight chance of being either killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Prior to World War II, our active military consisted of less than ten thousand soldiers. By the end of this war, almost two and a half million would have served. One in eight soldiers in the army was either killed or wounded. Comparatively, in World War I, six hundred fifty thousand served in the war, and more than sixty five thousand were killed in action, while one in three soldiers were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The death of Captain Forrest Walker Wiggins must have been tragic to his parents, his friends, his wife, and all who knew him. He was one amongst over one hundred ten thousand lost between the two global conflicts. Although Canada had been involved in other wars both before and after these, these proved the most significant by a wide margin in terms of toll on our population at that time.</p>
<p>When we stand for a moment of silence at annual school assemblies, when we set a day aside, year after year for what has now been a century, we do so solely committed to the memory of all the brave lost years ago. The purpose, however, is not merely to think on the large scale loss: it isn&#8217;t to consider numbers, to think of it as a mere percentage of our population.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s stated over and over again: &#8220;These men had hopes, dreams, futures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The magnitude of this statement is often lost over time and repetition. Allow me to provide some form of insight:</p>
<p>Though age ranged in both wars by close to thirty years between the youngest and oldest soldiers, the average age that most historians agree on between the two wars is between twenty-three and twenty five years old. The average age of allied soldiers killed in the two wars is thought to be even lower. It is very likely that out of all the names you hear called at the L.C.C. Remembrance day ceremony each year, most had only recently graduated.</p>
<p>At the age of seventeen and eighteen, many if not most of us here are still trying to figure out what to do with ourselves. We look forward to and await in agony what has been described as the best part of our lives, supposedly yet to come. It’s likely most of us haven’t even considered the possibility of not living long enough to reach that point.</p>
<p>This was a reality that these soldiers named each year at our assemblies not only considered, but also accepted. These young men were volunteers, aware that the consequences of war would likely lead to a dramatic change in lifestyle following the war, or perhaps none at all. Many did this around the same time they would have been doing exactly what we will be doing in one year&#8217;s time: going off to university. Except, rather than pack up their belongings and move into freshman housing complexes or fraternities, together, they got on ships and sailed far away to fight on hostile shores. They put their current lives and futures on hold, perhaps forever, for belief that they were needed.</p>
<p>You may ask yourself, as I did, as to what could possibly drive so many young individuals all too similar to ourselves to be so selfless. Looking around within my own world, it just doesn&#8217;t seem likely that in todays day and age, we might demonstrate the same pride and altruistic values for sake of ones people and homeland. Perhaps this sense of community and commitment to ones country was lost to the sands of time, maybe with the growth of our population, or simply because selflessness is now &#8220;outdated&#8221;. However, I still have faith that these values are still instilled somewhere, perhaps hidden deep within us all, and that maybe every year, for just one day, we can contemplate these acts of selflessness committed long before our time. Perhaps we might think on and realize the things that prompt such courage and generosity, that we might remember these things and incorporate them into our own lives in honour of those who fell while demonstrating <em>these</em> characteristics.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">- &#8211; &#8211; -</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t often feel inspired to write about depressing things, or elicit guilt or sorrow from those who might actually take the time to read what I write. On the contrary, I simply wish to convey the message that even though these rituals might seem repetitive and growingly insignificant after following them on a yearly basis, including pinning red flowers to our clothing and lowering flags, in fact, the reason we still practice them is with the purpose of remembering the extent of sacrifice made by those who likely didn’t understand how significant their actions were.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
