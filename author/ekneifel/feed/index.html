				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In accepting the role as Andrew Waxman/William Blake in the Pre-U play, I would like to take a moment to thank a few individuals who were really instrumental in my formation as a person. First and foremost, I’d like to thank the academy. Secondly, Thank you to my loving parents, two whom I accredit my literacy. Finally, I’d like to thank Arnold Schwarzenegger for instilling the love of acting in me from an early age. I am deeply humbled and honored to be acting in the Pre-U play, and to be working with my talented colleagues. This is a responsibility that I do not take lightly. I will strive to play these roles with the utmost accuracy to the fictional characters who are not based on real people, and to stay true to the vision of our director, playwright, and fellow Pre-U student, Sol Azrieli. I wish my fellow actors good luck as we embark on this journey, and invite the others to come help me build sets if they’d like to get involved behind the scenes. Hopefully, none of us actually breaks a leg before show night (except for Sol—he doesn’t really move much anyway); it will definitely be a show for the ages.</p>

<p>With December exams right around the corner, it comforts me to see this picture of just one (pre-co-ed) graduating class at LCC. To know that these (count ‘em) 54 boys went through what we’re going through right now, survived, and graduated, makes me feel like it’s all going to be okay (at least until winter break draws to a close, and we’re back in the thick of things). (There are a lot of parenthetical remarks in this post) (I should get back to studying) (You should too) ((((Good luck on your exams, you guys, and happy holidays))))</p>
<p>Footnote (it wouldn’t be an Emilie post without it): Daniel Wen is still the best lab partner to walk the face of the earth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m a new student at LCC, hailing all the way from good ol’ Plattsburgh, New York, which, technically, means I’m from a foreign country. My older brother went through the Pre-University Program in 2012, and, because I suffer from middle child syndrome, I had my reservations about following in his footsteps. I came to Pre-U anyway, though, for me. I wanted to be immersed in the rigorous program that Lower Canada College offers their students. I love the atmosphere that’s created here; this school is basically Hogwarts, except the people are a lot friendlier, and the only scary teacher is actually Welsh. I came to LCC because I wanted a change of scenery. I wanted to wear business attire to school every day. But most of all, I came to LCC to be lab partners with Daniel Wen.</p>
