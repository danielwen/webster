				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks back, I was sitting on the couch, alone, writing my Common App personal essay (for the fourth time) when I heard a knock at the door. Outside stood a middle aged man with a sign balanced in his arm, and a large hammer in the other. He was here to &#8220;put up the sign,&#8221; I overheard. I was, at that time, unaware of the small project my town had recently undertaken, to be revealed to you shortly. I later walked outside to inspect the sign that was now planted on my lawn, and found the following:</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-213 aligncenter" src="http://wwwebster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/photo-26-1024x768.jpg" alt="photo-26" width="532" height="399" /></p>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, my town had made a small project of identifying all the buildings once homes to soldiers lost to both world wars.</p>
<p>In my personal case, the walls I now live in had once been residence to an artillery soldier by the name of Cpt. Forrest Walker Wiggins. From the short obituary written about him in the Montreal Gazette in 1941, we know that he attended what is now Royal West Academy, and went on to become a three season athlete at McGill. Inspired by his family before him, he dreamed of becoming a serviceman one day, and was granted this wish in 1935. He was among the first waves of soldiers deployed by the Canadian Forces, arriving in England on Christmas day of 1940. He was killed merely three months later, the cause of his death lost to the ages. He was twenty eight years old.</p>
<p><span id="more-212"></span><br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>When you walk down Westminster Avenue, there isn&#8217;t too much that might draw your attention at first. However, once you notice the first of the signs tied to lamp posts like the one I&#8217;ve posted above, it truly serves to identify the way a community might appear following war. Every second lamp post bears a sign dedicated to a single fallen soldier from within my community, and this spans on for at least three blocks. Name after name, address after address, the number of young men lost from a single community that seems minuscule even today only goes to show the magnitude of the loss experienced what could be any small community.</p>
<p>Canada’s death toll seems light when contrasted with those of other countries who suffered during the war. However, we must also consider the percentage of servicemen killed per country, which was high among many of the allies. Those enlisted in the army, like Cpt. Wiggins, faced a one in eight chance of being either killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Prior to World War II, our active military consisted of less than ten thousand soldiers. By the end of this war, almost two and a half million would have served. One in eight soldiers in the army was either killed or wounded. Comparatively, in World War I, six hundred fifty thousand served in the war, and more than sixty five thousand were killed in action, while one in three soldiers were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The death of Captain Forrest Walker Wiggins must have been tragic to his parents, his friends, his wife, and all who knew him. He was one amongst over one hundred ten thousand lost between the two global conflicts. Although Canada had been involved in other wars both before and after these, these proved the most significant by a wide margin in terms of toll on our population at that time.</p>
<p>When we stand for a moment of silence at annual school assemblies, when we set a day aside, year after year for what has now been a century, we do so solely committed to the memory of all the brave lost years ago. The purpose, however, is not merely to think on the large scale loss: it isn&#8217;t to consider numbers, to think of it as a mere percentage of our population.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s stated over and over again: &#8220;These men had hopes, dreams, futures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The magnitude of this statement is often lost over time and repetition. Allow me to provide some form of insight:</p>
<p>Though age ranged in both wars by close to thirty years between the youngest and oldest soldiers, the average age that most historians agree on between the two wars is between twenty-three and twenty five years old. The average age of allied soldiers killed in the two wars is thought to be even lower. It is very likely that out of all the names you hear called at the L.C.C. Remembrance day ceremony each year, most had only recently graduated.</p>
<p>At the age of seventeen and eighteen, many if not most of us here are still trying to figure out what to do with ourselves. We look forward to and await in agony what has been described as the best part of our lives, supposedly yet to come. It’s likely most of us haven’t even considered the possibility of not living long enough to reach that point.</p>
<p>This was a reality that these soldiers named each year at our assemblies not only considered, but also accepted. These young men were volunteers, aware that the consequences of war would likely lead to a dramatic change in lifestyle following the war, or perhaps none at all. Many did this around the same time they would have been doing exactly what we will be doing in one year&#8217;s time: going off to university. Except, rather than pack up their belongings and move into freshman housing complexes or fraternities, together, they got on ships and sailed far away to fight on hostile shores. They put their current lives and futures on hold, perhaps forever, for belief that they were needed.</p>
<p>You may ask yourself, as I did, as to what could possibly drive so many young individuals all too similar to ourselves to be so selfless. Looking around within my own world, it just doesn&#8217;t seem likely that in todays day and age, we might demonstrate the same pride and altruistic values for sake of ones people and homeland. Perhaps this sense of community and commitment to ones country was lost to the sands of time, maybe with the growth of our population, or simply because selflessness is now &#8220;outdated&#8221;. However, I still have faith that these values are still instilled somewhere, perhaps hidden deep within us all, and that maybe every year, for just one day, we can contemplate these acts of selflessness committed long before our time. Perhaps we might think on and realize the things that prompt such courage and generosity, that we might remember these things and incorporate them into our own lives in honour of those who fell while demonstrating <em>these</em> characteristics.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t often feel inspired to write about depressing things, or elicit guilt or sorrow from those who might actually take the time to read what I write. On the contrary, I simply wish to convey the message that even though these rituals might seem repetitive and growingly insignificant after following them on a yearly basis, including pinning red flowers to our clothing and lowering flags, in fact, the reason we still practice them is with the purpose of remembering the extent of sacrifice made by those who likely didn’t understand how significant their actions were.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In light of the recent development of this website, I decided to help out Daniel and help him with creating some initial substance to post in order to make it at least seem as though we need a website to help organize all the useful information we wish to distribute around.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps the following information may not prove useful to you, but I digress.</p>
<p>So in this first &#8220;blog&#8221; post, and I use the word &#8220;blog&#8221; lightly, I&#8217;ve decided to construct a users guide towards helping all of you cope with the complications and the pain of your standardized testing.</p>
<p>&#8230;or on second thought, maybe I&#8217;m better off giving you a list of complications and pain-inflicting problems associated with standardized testing, and hope that somehow, being more dissatisfied with the system currently in place will bring you comfort. And if not, well I apologize towards all 10 of you who actually read this through: I may have made things worse.</p>
<p><span id="more-156"></span><br />
If you&#8217;re planning on applying to schools across the southern border, you&#8217;ve almost definitely already acquainted yourself with standardized testing by now, by either writing a test or studying for one (unless you&#8217;re taking a gap year: S/O to Tyler). If you&#8217;re not applying to these schools down south,</p>
<p>well&#8230;</p>
<p>unfortunately for you, you&#8217;ve still acquainted yourself with standardized testing in the form of those around you complaining about them.</p>
<p>No matter what or how you&#8217;ve done it, you now all know enough about standardized tests like the SAT and ACT to relate to what I&#8217;m saying. Or the DSST, CLEP, UCAS, or whatever weird acronym you&#8217;ve chosen as your metaphorical method of transportation into college.</p>
<p>Mind you, I personally think CLEP sounds like something you get after consuming tap water in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#8217;ll use my own experiences to guide my example, as although I can&#8217;t speak for any of you, I can only assume you all experienced something similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Rejoice in the dawn of your senior year of Quebec high school, and that you are nearing the end of the worst part your life&#8217;s period of inculcation.</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-169" src="http://wwwebster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-8.52.18-PM-300x159.png" alt="Sike" width="300" height="159" /></p>
<p>In fact, you begin to find out that all of that was the easy part of your educational career. I mean, I guess everyone has been saying that to you for years, but realistically, denial has left you believing that retirement begins at age 17. Not so.</p>
<p>Considering you are destined for grade 12 next year (personally, I made that decision based on the now-unthinkable possibility of completing the IB diploma), you are drawn into the wave of stress to write the SAT (or other parasitic sounding test) in order to get you some sort of base standing on where you can get into University.</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>Out of sheer panic, you drop hundreds of dollars to pay for a bunch of SAT books, most of which is going towards providing you with a source of comfort: I have the material therefore I will prepare for this test.</p>
<p>Step 4:</p>
<p>Register for a test date, paying an eventual additional hundred dollars to write the test.</p>
<p>Then, prepare for this test.</p>
<p>Step 5A: (Many weeks later)</p>
<p>I prepared for this test. I am ready to write it.</p>
<p>Step 5B: (The night before the test)</p>
<p>I (am not) prepared for this test. I am (not) ready to write it.</p>
<p>Regardless of your level of preparedness, you make your way downtown (or to LCC if you were lucky enough to grab a spot) to the testing centre, where you may encounter, as I did, the closest to a dictator one will ever see in North America (seriously, the way some of them read the instructions is more stressful than the entirety of the test itself).</p>
<p>You emerge, several years later, mentally drained and somewhat relieved. It&#8217;s all over, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is where the fun really begins.</p>
<p>Collegeboard, the company which is responsible for the SAT test offers you the possibility of sending four free scores to colleges so long as you send them within the two week period after writing your test. Conveniently, you don&#8217;t get your scores back until after that, so it essentially means firing them off into the darkness. In grade 11, you probably aren&#8217;t even considering any universities seriously yet, and even if you were you wouldn&#8217;t want them receiving a bad score. So you wait it out until it comes time to actually send your scores in to some of your desired universities, you get a lovely page that says something like this:</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-170 aligncenter" src="http://wwwebster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-9.38.27-PM-300x45.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-20 at 9.38.27 PM" width="300" height="45" /></p>
<p>Wait, let me get this straight:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-171 aligncenter" src="http://wwwebster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-9.45.24-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-20 at 9.45.24 PM" width="176" height="86" /></p>
<p>I have to pay a company&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;that I already payed over a hundred dollars to in order to write a test&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; <strong>eleven dollars and twenty five cents</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;<strong>to send an email</strong> with a PDF file attached to it.</p>
<p>Wait, whats this?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-172" src="http://wwwebster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-9.38.48-PM-300x64.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-20 at 9.38.48 PM" width="300" height="64" /></p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to tax me on that?</p>
<p>Lets jump into economics really quickly: as many of you may know, standardized testing is an inelastic good: most people are going to pay for it regardless of how much it costs.</p>
<p>And to be clear: it&#8217;s an expensive price to pay to write a single mass produced test.</p>
<p>But to charge money to literally take my scores and put it in a mailing system online, followed by taxing that as if one was selling a commercial good is borderline criminal activity.</p>
<p>I mean, paying an extra 130$ to apply to 10 schools wasn&#8217;t exactly part of the plan, but at this point, you&#8217;re going to do it anyways, right?</p>
<p>Talk about taking advantage of inelasticity. You IB people can all use this example on your next IA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the bright side of all of this, however, is that at the very least, the testing part of your application process is now over.</p>
<p>Oh, whats that? I need to write subject tests which will test all my knowledge on certain subjects I&#8217;ve learned in high school in order to be eligible for my desired program?</p>
<p>In that case,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like its time to start a new application:</p>
<p>https://careers.mcdonalds.ca/mcd-careers/applicant/</p>
<p style="text-align: center">- &#8211; &#8211; -</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t promise any form of consistency towards posting anything else ever, honestly, but hey, at least now I feel as though I&#8217;ve contributed adequately towards Pre-U life.</p>
<p>Possibly creativity hours for CAS.<br />
Do I get community service for this?</p>
