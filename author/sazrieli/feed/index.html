				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My computer died last Thursday. My friend. There was no procession, no wake. There was no obituary. My computer was an extension of myself. It was an extension of my psyche. It was the repository of all my mindless musings and iMessage conversations. It was where I kept my work. It was where I kept my music. It was where I kept screenshots, love-letters, songs, short stories. My computer was my brain. It was an appendage that extended from my fingertips and enabled me to tap into a record of my memories and emotions. </p>
<p>Now, it’s gone, and all I’m tapping into is an empty Pages document, forced to settle for this sorry excuse for word processing software now that my subscription to Microsoft Office has expired. </p>
<p><span id="more-188"></span></p>
<p>I was working on an economics project. I wanted to transfer some videos taken on my phone to my late laptop. I went to Tech Support to retrieve a USB cable for my phone. The IT guy (who shall remain unnamed) regrettably informed me of their no-lending policy regarding those particular cables. I told him it wasn’t a problem, that I’d just airdrop it or something. If only I’d known. Maybe I’d have been more stubborn. Maybe not. </p>
<p>The problems began as innocently as any minor issue would: I got the rainbow pinwheel. I forced a shut down, and restarted. Or, rather, I attempted to restart. After booting up for six hours, my old friend went blank. My computer was in a coma. </p>
<p>I took it to the IT help desk. The following day. </p>
<p>“Is there anything you can do?”</p>
<p>“If we’re lucky, we might be able to save some of the data.”</p>
<p>That was all I needed to hear. At that moment I was inclined to believe in a soul. In a transcendent entity that exists within all of us, man and computers alike. An immortal soul. Immortal data. I left the lab to go to my physics class. </p>
<p>Around three hours later, I returned. They had hooked my laptop up to all sorts of machines, like they were conducting surgery. Unfortunately, as I was soon to come to terms with, there’s no procedure for recovering one’s soul. The IT man, who knew far better than me the graveness of the situation, looked at me. Stone-faced, solemn. Calm. </p>
<p>“Give it to me straight, doc,” I said, half-ironically. </p>
<p>“We’ve started the process of recovering the data.” </p>
<p>“How long will it take?”</p>
<p>“Estimated time of recovery is 3 years.” </p>
<p>I simply did not have that kind of time. I loved my computer dearly. I needed my documents desperately. I so wanted to have a record of my past. But, who was I kidding? My computer was dead long before its hard drive crashed.<br />
“If you want, we can get you a new hard drive.” </p>
<p>I politely declined. It wasn’t the loss of my physical computer that filled me with remorse. It was the fact that my data, what I considered to be an extension of myself. When I proverbially (although in this case I suppose it’s more literal) pulled the plug on my friend, I felt like a part of me died. </p>
<p>I don’t know if I believe in an afterlife. I so desperately want to believe that my journals and memories are still out there, somewhere in hyperspace. I want to believe that they’re not gone forever. That they didn’t die with the body. </p>
<p>Am I to believe that my songs and those pictures are gone forever? Am I to believe that my horoscopes and essays may as well never have existed? </p>
<p>They’re out there somewhere. If only in the software that is my mind. I am a machine that will not crash. Not even in the face of having lost everything that is dear to me. </p>
<p>So, to my computer, may you rest in peace. You will not be forgotten. Life is cruel sometimes. You were taken away from me before I could back you up. But in a way, that’s ok. I will carry your contents with me not on an external hard drive, but in my heart. </p>
