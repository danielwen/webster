				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the chance to speak with the talented Sol Azrieli about the Pre-U play. For those unaware, the play is a comedy that reflects our lives as Pre-U students. The plot revolves around a character named Andrew Waxman and his social and academic escapades. Sol has made it explicit that Andrew is the only character based on a real person.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the onset,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I knew that the main character would be Andrew Waxman. And his best friend would be William Blake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The primary antagonist, whose ethnicity (and thereby, whose name) is not yet fixed, appeared in the very early drafts. Most of the other characters were then added as the story unfolded under the author&#8217;s skillful hand.</p>
<p><span id="more-267"></span></p>
<p>Sol wrote the bulk of the script—forty pages and eleven thousand words—in a few hectic days before the end of the winter break. He succeeded in incorporating enough characters to give roles to everyone interested in acting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hardest part was sticking to it. Once I started writing, I found I could write ten pages at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among other challenges, our playwright faced numerous redactions from the Pre-U office. He was also disappointed to find out that his project would receive zero budgetary support.</p>
<p>However, this fact does not discourage Emilie Kneifel, the art director. Emilie said she would forego large, elaborate sets in favor of simpler, decorative elements. Her attention to detail led her to contribute many creative subtleties to the play, such as the setting &#8220;Mulk.&#8221; As for costumes, she believes business attire would be most appropriate due to its significance to our identity.</p>
<p>Some might remember that the play was originally intended as a musical. According to Sol, &#8220;the idea hasn&#8217;t disappeared.&#8221; For now, he is waiting to gauge the players&#8217; interest in producing a musical.</p>
<p>Auditions took place last week, and rehearsals are now in full swing. We will likely present the play in April.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In accepting the role as Andrew Waxman/William Blake in the Pre-U play, I would like to take a moment to thank a few individuals who were really instrumental in my formation as a person. First and foremost, I’d like to thank the academy. Secondly, Thank you to my loving parents, two whom I accredit my literacy. Finally, I’d like to thank Arnold Schwarzenegger for instilling the love of acting in me from an early age. I am deeply humbled and honored to be acting in the Pre-U play, and to be working with my talented colleagues. This is a responsibility that I do not take lightly. I will strive to play these roles with the utmost accuracy to the fictional characters who are not based on real people, and to stay true to the vision of our director, playwright, and fellow Pre-U student, Sol Azrieli. I wish my fellow actors good luck as we embark on this journey, and invite the others to come help me build sets if they’d like to get involved behind the scenes. Hopefully, none of us actually breaks a leg before show night (except for Sol—he doesn’t really move much anyway); it will definitely be a show for the ages.</p>

		<title>The Dichotomy of Interview Styles in the US and UK</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sitting at my first US university interview, I marvelled at the great disparity in the interview styles of American schools versus their British counterparts. This gulf between education systems is as deep and wide as the ocean that separates the two nations. Had I not felt nervous, I would have found the contrast comical.</p>
<p>Retrospectively, I should have been more astonished by my UK interviews. However, since I experienced them first, I had no preconceptions on what constitutes an interview. To their credit, Imperial College London conducted a session with me that qualified as an interview. Although the discussion was heavily academic, I enjoyed thinking out loud about how I would go about solving interesting scientific problems.</p>
<p>My interview with Cambridge was another matter; I would not call it an interview, but rather an interrogation.</p>
<p><span id="more-260"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Interrogation&#8221; is not original. Others have heard it and relayed it to my ears. Admittedly, the word is slightly harsh, and a more precise description could be &#8220;a sample of the tutoring system.&#8221; In fact, my &#8220;interview&#8221; consisted of doing math and physics problems on a sheet of paper while my &#8220;interviewer&#8221; watched and, every so often, interjected. Little was spoken; I could count full sentences on my fingers. No words were expended on what I liked about the school, why I wanted to study engineering, or anything personal. Academic performance is all that matters—according to Cambridge, at least.</p>
<p>With these memories fresh in my mind, I was amused by my US interview because it fell on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. I talked exclusively about my extracurricular activities, many of which have no pertinence whatsoever to my area of study. As a parallel example, one surely must play football in order to become an astrophysicist. Of course, diversity in the community is important, but US universities almost valorize this facet to the point of eclipsing the primary objective of educational institutions: to educate. Indeed, institutions of a certain reputation treat academic performance as secondary and regard it with enough narcissism. Based on what my interviewer said, they assume that, since you are applying to their glorious school, you must have the sufficient grades to do so. Therefore, there is no need to talk about academics.</p>
<p>US and UK universities have entirely different approaches to interviews. If they are among your options, whichever you choose depends on your outlook on school and life in general. I am tired of both.</p>

<p>With December exams right around the corner, it comforts me to see this picture of just one (pre-co-ed) graduating class at LCC. To know that these (count ‘em) 54 boys went through what we’re going through right now, survived, and graduated, makes me feel like it’s all going to be okay (at least until winter break draws to a close, and we’re back in the thick of things). (There are a lot of parenthetical remarks in this post) (I should get back to studying) (You should too) ((((Good luck on your exams, you guys, and happy holidays))))</p>
<p>Footnote (it wouldn’t be an Emilie post without it): Daniel Wen is still the best lab partner to walk the face of the earth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks back, I was sitting on the couch, alone, writing my Common App personal essay (for the fourth time) when I heard a knock at the door. Outside stood a middle aged man with a sign balanced in his arm, and a large hammer in the other. He was here to &#8220;put up the sign,&#8221; I overheard. I was, at that time, unaware of the small project my town had recently undertaken, to be revealed to you shortly. I later walked outside to inspect the sign that was now planted on my lawn, and found the following:</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-213 aligncenter" src="http://wwwebster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/photo-26-1024x768.jpg" alt="photo-26" width="532" height="399" /></p>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, my town had made a small project of identifying all the buildings once homes to soldiers lost to both world wars.</p>
<p>In my personal case, the walls I now live in had once been residence to an artillery soldier by the name of Cpt. Forrest Walker Wiggins. From the short obituary written about him in the Montreal Gazette in 1941, we know that he attended what is now Royal West Academy, and went on to become a three season athlete at McGill. Inspired by his family before him, he dreamed of becoming a serviceman one day, and was granted this wish in 1935. He was among the first waves of soldiers deployed by the Canadian Forces, arriving in England on Christmas day of 1940. He was killed merely three months later, the cause of his death lost to the ages. He was twenty eight years old.</p>
<p><span id="more-212"></span><br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>When you walk down Westminster Avenue, there isn&#8217;t too much that might draw your attention at first. However, once you notice the first of the signs tied to lamp posts like the one I&#8217;ve posted above, it truly serves to identify the way a community might appear following war. Every second lamp post bears a sign dedicated to a single fallen soldier from within my community, and this spans on for at least three blocks. Name after name, address after address, the number of young men lost from a single community that seems minuscule even today only goes to show the magnitude of the loss experienced what could be any small community.</p>
<p>Canada’s death toll seems light when contrasted with those of other countries who suffered during the war. However, we must also consider the percentage of servicemen killed per country, which was high among many of the allies. Those enlisted in the army, like Cpt. Wiggins, faced a one in eight chance of being either killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Prior to World War II, our active military consisted of less than ten thousand soldiers. By the end of this war, almost two and a half million would have served. One in eight soldiers in the army was either killed or wounded. Comparatively, in World War I, six hundred fifty thousand served in the war, and more than sixty five thousand were killed in action, while one in three soldiers were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The death of Captain Forrest Walker Wiggins must have been tragic to his parents, his friends, his wife, and all who knew him. He was one amongst over one hundred ten thousand lost between the two global conflicts. Although Canada had been involved in other wars both before and after these, these proved the most significant by a wide margin in terms of toll on our population at that time.</p>
<p>When we stand for a moment of silence at annual school assemblies, when we set a day aside, year after year for what has now been a century, we do so solely committed to the memory of all the brave lost years ago. The purpose, however, is not merely to think on the large scale loss: it isn&#8217;t to consider numbers, to think of it as a mere percentage of our population.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s stated over and over again: &#8220;These men had hopes, dreams, futures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The magnitude of this statement is often lost over time and repetition. Allow me to provide some form of insight:</p>
<p>Though age ranged in both wars by close to thirty years between the youngest and oldest soldiers, the average age that most historians agree on between the two wars is between twenty-three and twenty five years old. The average age of allied soldiers killed in the two wars is thought to be even lower. It is very likely that out of all the names you hear called at the L.C.C. Remembrance day ceremony each year, most had only recently graduated.</p>
<p>At the age of seventeen and eighteen, many if not most of us here are still trying to figure out what to do with ourselves. We look forward to and await in agony what has been described as the best part of our lives, supposedly yet to come. It’s likely most of us haven’t even considered the possibility of not living long enough to reach that point.</p>
<p>This was a reality that these soldiers named each year at our assemblies not only considered, but also accepted. These young men were volunteers, aware that the consequences of war would likely lead to a dramatic change in lifestyle following the war, or perhaps none at all. Many did this around the same time they would have been doing exactly what we will be doing in one year&#8217;s time: going off to university. Except, rather than pack up their belongings and move into freshman housing complexes or fraternities, together, they got on ships and sailed far away to fight on hostile shores. They put their current lives and futures on hold, perhaps forever, for belief that they were needed.</p>
<p>You may ask yourself, as I did, as to what could possibly drive so many young individuals all too similar to ourselves to be so selfless. Looking around within my own world, it just doesn&#8217;t seem likely that in todays day and age, we might demonstrate the same pride and altruistic values for sake of ones people and homeland. Perhaps this sense of community and commitment to ones country was lost to the sands of time, maybe with the growth of our population, or simply because selflessness is now &#8220;outdated&#8221;. However, I still have faith that these values are still instilled somewhere, perhaps hidden deep within us all, and that maybe every year, for just one day, we can contemplate these acts of selflessness committed long before our time. Perhaps we might think on and realize the things that prompt such courage and generosity, that we might remember these things and incorporate them into our own lives in honour of those who fell while demonstrating <em>these</em> characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE MOST THAT  MAN CAN GIVE</p>
<p style="text-align: center">LIFE ITSELF</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> FOR GOD</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> FOR KING AND COUNTRY</p>
<p style="text-align: center">FOR LOVED ONES HOME AND EMPIRE</p>
<p style="text-align: center">FOR THE SACRED CAUSE OF JUSTICE</p>
<p style="text-align: center">AND</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE FREEDOM OF THE WORLD</p>
<p style="text-align: center">-<em>Tomb of the Unknown Warrior</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center">- &#8211; &#8211; -</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t often feel inspired to write about depressing things, or elicit guilt or sorrow from those who might actually take the time to read what I write. On the contrary, I simply wish to convey the message that even though these rituals might seem repetitive and growingly insignificant after following them on a yearly basis, including pinning red flowers to our clothing and lowering flags, in fact, the reason we still practice them is with the purpose of remembering the extent of sacrifice made by those who likely didn’t understand how significant their actions were.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My computer died last Thursday. My friend. There was no procession, no wake. There was no obituary. My computer was an extension of myself. It was an extension of my psyche. It was the repository of all my mindless musings and iMessage conversations. It was where I kept my work. It was where I kept my music. It was where I kept screenshots, love-letters, songs, short stories. My computer was my brain. It was an appendage that extended from my fingertips and enabled me to tap into a record of my memories and emotions. </p>
<p>Now, it’s gone, and all I’m tapping into is an empty Pages document, forced to settle for this sorry excuse for word processing software now that my subscription to Microsoft Office has expired. </p>
<p><span id="more-188"></span></p>
<p>I was working on an economics project. I wanted to transfer some videos taken on my phone to my late laptop. I went to Tech Support to retrieve a USB cable for my phone. The IT guy (who shall remain unnamed) regrettably informed me of their no-lending policy regarding those particular cables. I told him it wasn’t a problem, that I’d just airdrop it or something. If only I’d known. Maybe I’d have been more stubborn. Maybe not. </p>
<p>The problems began as innocently as any minor issue would: I got the rainbow pinwheel. I forced a shut down, and restarted. Or, rather, I attempted to restart. After booting up for six hours, my old friend went blank. My computer was in a coma. </p>
<p>I took it to the IT help desk. The following day. </p>
<p>“Is there anything you can do?”</p>
<p>“If we’re lucky, we might be able to save some of the data.”</p>
<p>That was all I needed to hear. At that moment I was inclined to believe in a soul. In a transcendent entity that exists within all of us, man and computers alike. An immortal soul. Immortal data. I left the lab to go to my physics class. </p>
<p>Around three hours later, I returned. They had hooked my laptop up to all sorts of machines, like they were conducting surgery. Unfortunately, as I was soon to come to terms with, there’s no procedure for recovering one’s soul. The IT man, who knew far better than me the graveness of the situation, looked at me. Stone-faced, solemn. Calm. </p>
<p>“Give it to me straight, doc,” I said, half-ironically. </p>
<p>“We’ve started the process of recovering the data.” </p>
<p>“How long will it take?”</p>
<p>“Estimated time of recovery is 3 years.” </p>
<p>I simply did not have that kind of time. I loved my computer dearly. I needed my documents desperately. I so wanted to have a record of my past. But, who was I kidding? My computer was dead long before its hard drive crashed.<br />
“If you want, we can get you a new hard drive.” </p>
<p>I politely declined. It wasn’t the loss of my physical computer that filled me with remorse. It was the fact that my data, what I considered to be an extension of myself. When I proverbially (although in this case I suppose it’s more literal) pulled the plug on my friend, I felt like a part of me died. </p>
<p>I don’t know if I believe in an afterlife. I so desperately want to believe that my journals and memories are still out there, somewhere in hyperspace. I want to believe that they’re not gone forever. That they didn’t die with the body. </p>
<p>Am I to believe that my songs and those pictures are gone forever? Am I to believe that my horoscopes and essays may as well never have existed? </p>
<p>They’re out there somewhere. If only in the software that is my mind. I am a machine that will not crash. Not even in the face of having lost everything that is dear to me. </p>
<p>So, to my computer, may you rest in peace. You will not be forgotten. Life is cruel sometimes. You were taken away from me before I could back you up. But in a way, that’s ok. I will carry your contents with me not on an external hard drive, but in my heart. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m a new student at LCC, hailing all the way from good ol’ Plattsburgh, New York, which, technically, means I’m from a foreign country. My older brother went through the Pre-University Program in 2012, and, because I suffer from middle child syndrome, I had my reservations about following in his footsteps. I came to Pre-U anyway, though, for me. I wanted to be immersed in the rigorous program that Lower Canada College offers their students. I love the atmosphere that’s created here; this school is basically Hogwarts, except the people are a lot friendlier, and the only scary teacher is actually Welsh. I came to LCC because I wanted a change of scenery. I wanted to wear business attire to school every day. But most of all, I came to LCC to be lab partners with Daniel Wen.</p>
